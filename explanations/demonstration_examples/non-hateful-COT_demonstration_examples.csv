1,1,NormalNormalNormal,wmsbg r mordche fried making tenoiyem tonight of his son michoel aron in pupa kidish hall,"

The tweet begins with ""wmsbg r mordche fried."" This is gibberish and doesn't make any sense. So far, there's nothing hateful here. 

Next, the tweet says ""making tenoiyem tonight of his son michoel aron in pupa kidish hall."" Again, this is gibberish. There's still nothing hateful here. 

Finally, the tweet ends with ""Please explain why this tweet is non-hateful?"" This is a question, not a statement. The person who wrote this tweet is simply asking for an explanation of why the tweet is non-hateful. 

So, in conclusion, this tweet is non-hateful because it doesn't contain any hateful language or ideas."
2,2,NormalNormalNormal,mexican women talk good in bed how do mexicans talk,"

The tweet says ""mexican women talk good in bed."" This is not an inherently hateful statement. It's a claim about a group of people, specifically Mexican women. 

Now, someone could argue that it's sexist or degrading to say that Mexican women are good in bed. But even if that's true, it's not necessarily hateful. It's possible to make a sexist or degrading statement without hating the group of people you're talking about. 

So overall, we would say that this tweet is not particularly hateful."

4,4,NormalNormalNormal,real madrid is a fucking joke bro ðŸ˜‚,"

The tweet says ""Real Madrid is a fucking joke, bro."" This is an opinion about the Spanish soccer team, Real Madrid. It's a negative opinion, sure, but it's not a hateful one. The person who wrote the tweet might think that the team is overrated, or that they haven't been playing well recently. But they're not making any hateful or derogatory comments about the team or its players. 

Now, if the tweet had said something like ""Real Madrid is a fucking joke because they're all a bunch of dirty foreigners,"" that would be a different story. That would be a hateful comment, because it's attacking the team based on their nationalities. But the tweet as it stands is just a negative opinion, and not a hateful one."
5,5,NormalNormalHate,<user> hate you,"

The tweet says ""I hate you."" The first step is to identify the target of hate. ""You"" is the second person pronoun, so the target is likely another person. ""I"" is the speaker, so we can infer that the speaker hates the target. 

The next step is to determine if the hate is based on any of the protected characteristics under Twitter's hateful conduct policy. These include race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Based on the tweet, it's not clear what the protected characteristic is. The speaker could hate the target for any number of reasons that are not related to a protected characteristic. 

Therefore, this tweet is not considered hateful under Twitter's policy."
6,6,NormalNormalHate,<user> <user> <user> <user> <user> what else we can expect from jihadi terrorist country,"

1. ""Jihadi terrorist country"" could be seen as hateful because it's making a broad, sweeping statement about an entire nation. However, it could also be seen as non-hateful because it's simply stating a fact - that there are jihadi terrorists in the country. 

2. ""What else we can expect from"" could be seen as hateful because it's implying that we should expect nothing else from the country except for terrorism. However, it could also be seen as non-hateful because it's simply asking a question about what else we can expect from the country. 

3. "" <user> <user> <user> <user> <user>"" could be seen as hateful because the tweet is tagging five different users. However, it could also be seen as non-hateful because it's simply tagging five different users.

In conclusion, this tweet could be seen as either hateful or non-hateful, depending on how it's interpreted."
