0,0,NormalNormalNormal,mexican women talk good in bed how do mexicans talk,"

The tweet says ""mexican women talk good in bed."" This is not an inherently hateful statement. It's a claim about a group of people, specifically Mexican women.

So overall, we would say that this tweet is not particularly hateful."
