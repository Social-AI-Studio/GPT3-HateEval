0,0,NormalNormalNormal,little dogs always look like they hate you,"

1. What does the tweet say?

""Small dogs always look like they hate you.""

2. What does this mean?

This means that, in the opinion of the person who wrote this tweet, small dogs always look like they hate the person who is looking at them.

This is hateful because it is making a generalization about a group of creatures (small dogs) and saying that they all have a certain trait (looking like they hate people). This is not only untrue, but it is also hurtful and offensive to small dog owners."
1,1,NormalNormalHate,<number> million jews died in the holocaust thingswesaybutdontmean,"

First, the tweet states that ""a million Jews died in the Holocaust."" This is a fact. However, the tweet does not mention anything about the suffering of the Jews during the Holocaust. 

Second, the tweet says that ""things we say but don't mean."" This could be interpreted in a number of ways, but one interpretation could be that the tweet is saying that the Holocaust never happened, and that the Jews who died were not actually killed. 

This interpretation is hateful because it denies the reality of the Holocaust and the suffering of the Jews. It also casts doubt on the veracity of the Holocaust, which is a historical fact."
2,2,NormalHateHate,too many of you woman turn into retarded ass unstable creatures when you ain t got a nigga,"

1. The tweet starts with ""too many of you woman."" This is immediately setting up women as a group to be critiqued. 
2. The tweet continues with ""turn into retarded ass unstable creatures."" This is a ableist slur against women, calling them mentally disabled and animals. 
3. The tweet ends with ""when you ain't got a nigga."" This is implying that women are only stable and sane when they have a man, and that without a man they are nothing. 

This tweet is hateful because it is sexist, ableist, and demeaning towards women."
3,3,HateHateHate,i hate black people you tell a nigger not to do something and they go on and do it niggerantics,"

The tweet starts out with ""I hate black people."" This is a clear statement of hate towards an entire group of people based on the color of their skin. 

The tweet continues, ""You tell a nigger not to do something and they go on and do it."" This is a harmful stereotype that suggests that black people are disobedient and incapable of following simple instructions. 

Lastly, the tweet ends with ""niggerantics."" This is a play on the word ""antics,"" but it is also a derogatory term used to describe the supposed foolish and childish behavior of black people. 

All in all, this tweet is full of hate towards black people. It is racist, stereotype-based, and demeaning."
